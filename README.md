Google Midi Hack-a-thon 2016 project

My idea for the Google Midi Hack-A-Thon was to use Midi controllers to accomplish non-musical tasks on mobile devices. By integrating with Tasker (http://tasker.dinglisch.net/) I was able to dynamically map midi keys to user defined Tasker actions. Tasker is required in order for this application to work properly. Here are just a few examples of Tasker defined actions I found to work well with Midi: 

- Mapping Midi buttons to the Android D-Pad to navigate system apps, email, facebook, etc
- Mapping Midi to launch apps like Gmail or Instagram
- Mapping Midi to Android controls like "Home", "Back", "Search", "Ok Google"
- Mapping Midi to launch Accessability Settings
- Mapping Midi to output text to speech (variables can be passed to and from Tasker so this could offer some dynamic rich information given the knowledge of how Tasker works)
